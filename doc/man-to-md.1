.SH SYNOPSIS
$
\fBman-to-md.pl\fR
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]
<\fImanpage.roff\fR
>\fIoutput.md\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is a filter
that reads \fBman\fR(7)-formatted nroff man pages
and outputs Markdown.
It can be used to automatically convert
man page files
to Markdown README files.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-paste\-section\-after\fR \fISECTION\fR:\fIFILENAME\fR
Instructs the program to attach a Markdown file
after the section named \fISECTION\fR
has been completely written to the output.
\fISECTION\fR must be an exact match of the input section name.
If the input contains no such section,
the file will be attached to the end of the output.
The attached file contents will have the exact \fIFILENAME\fR (without the \fB.md\fR extension)
as their top-level section title.
.br
This option can be supplied more than once.
Multiple files for the same section will be attached in the options' order.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paste\-section\-before\fR \fISECTION\fR:\fIFILENAME\fR
Like \fB\-\-paste\-section\-after\fR,
but attaches the file contents
to the output
just \fIbefore\fR the named section is written.
.TP
\fB\-\-paste-after\fR \fISECTION\fR:\fIFILENAME\fR
Like \fB\-\-paste\-section\-after\fR, but does not add a section title.
.TP
\fB\-\-paste-before\fR \fISECTION\fR:\fIFILENAME\fR
Like \fB\-\-paste\-section\-before\fR, but does not add a section title.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-comment\fR [\fICOMMENT\fR]
Adds an invisible comment as first line.
Without the argument, it uses this default comment:
.br
\(lq\fIThis file was autogenerated from the man page with 'make README.md'\fR\(rq.
.TP
.B \-\-escaped-dashes
Don't remove the backslash from escaped dashes (\\\-).
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-word\fR \fIWORD\fR
Adds a \fIWORD\fR to the list of known words
not to be titlecased in section titles.
(All other words will be titlecased
except some known English stopwords which will be lowercased.)
.br
This option can be supplied more than once
to add multiple known words.
.TP
.BR \-f ", " \-\-formatted\-code
Allows simple formatting in \fB.nf\fR-\fB.fi\fR code blocks
and in the Synopsis line.
(Without this option,
all formatting in code block and in the Synopsis line
will be removed.)
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Shows program help.
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-version
Shows version and license information.
.SH STANDARDS
This program understands many \fBman\fR(7) nroff commands and macros
commonly used in man page files.
For a complete list, see\ 
.\" INTERNAL-LINK
<doc/Commands.md>.
.P
The program emits Markdown syntax
that should be readable with most Markdown editors/viewers.
See\ 
.\" INTERNAL-LINK
<doc/Markdown_Output_Format.md>
for more information.
.P
The program makes several assumptions about the input format
that are not standardized
but seem to be fairly commonplace
in man pages; see\ 
.\" INTERNAL-LINK
<doc/Input_Format.md>.
It does not yet understand the newer \fBmdoc\fR(7) format.
